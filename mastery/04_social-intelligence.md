Social intelligence

## See people as they are :

Often the greatest obstacle to our pursuit of Mastery comes from the emotional drain we experience in dealing with the resistance and manipulation of the people around us. If we are not careful, our mind will become absorbed in endless political intrigues and battles. The principal problem we face in the social Arena is our naive tendency to project on two people our emotional needs and desires of the moment. We misread their intentions and react in ways that cause confusion or conflict. Social intelligence is the ability to see people in the most realistic light possible. By moving past our usual self absorption, we can learn to focus deeply on others reading their behavior in the moment, seeing what motivates them, and discerning any possible manipulative tendencies. Navigating smoothly the social environment, we have more time and energy to focus on the learning and acquiring skills. Success attend without this intelligence is not true mastery and will not last.

## Keys to Mastery

You must allow everyone the right to exist in accordance with the character he has, whatever it turns out to be: and all you should strive to do is to make use of this character in such a way as it's kind of nature permits, rather than to hope for any alteration in it, or to condemn it offhand for what it is. This is the true sense of the maxim-* Live and let live...* To become indignant at (people's) conduct is as foolish as to be angry with a stone because it rolls into your path. And with many people the wisest thing you can do, is to resolve to make use of those whom you cannot alter.

**Naive Perspective** - The naive perspective makes us feel sensitive and vulnerable. With colleagues in the work environment, we fail to see the source of their envy or the reason for their manipulations; our attempts at influencing them are based on the assumptions that they want the same things as ourselves. With mentors and bosses, we project onto them our childhood fantasies, becoming unnecessarily adoring or fearful of authority figures and creating stormy and brittle relationships in the process.

Social Intelligence is nothing more than the process of discarding the Naive perspective and approaching some more realistic. It involves focusing our attention outward instead of inward, honing the observational and empathic skills that we naturally possess. It means moving past our tendency to idealize and demonize people, and seeing and accepting them as they are.

To be truly charming and socially effective you have to understand people, and to understand them you have to get outside yourself and immerse your mind in their world.

**OBSERVE BEFORE YOU REACT.**

Social intelligence consists of two components.

First there is *specific knowledge of human nature* - namely the ability to read people, to get a feel for how they see the world, and to understand their individuality.


Second, there is the *general knowledge of human nature*, which means accumulating an understanding of the overall patterns of human behavior that transcends us as individuals, including some of the darker qualities we often disregard.
